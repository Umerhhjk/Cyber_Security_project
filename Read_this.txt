To do:

RSA Decryption function doesnt work.. (Transaction GUI line no 67)

Once RSA data is obtained, uncomment lines from get_data_from_QR_code, and display that data in a new window (Transaction GUI line no 97)

If hash of message doesnt match hash of this message, print "message corrupted or changed" on console and destroy this window

implement QRs_redeemed.txt , which will contain all the QR codes that have been redeemed so they cant be redeemed again
